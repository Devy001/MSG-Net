# Dependency
The codes are based on <a href="https://github.com/BVLC/caffe">caffe</a> and Matlab.

# Installation and Running
You need to install <a href="https://github.com/BVLC/caffe">caffe</a> and remeber to complie matcaffe. You can put the folder <code>MSGNet-release</code> in <code>caffe/examples</code>. Finally, you need to get into the the directory of <code>examples/MSGNet-release</code>, and run <code>MSGNet.m</code>. </li>

# Training data
It consists 58 RGBD images from MPI Sintel depth dataset, and 34 RGBD images (6, 10 and 18 images are from 2001, 2006 and 2014 datasets respectively) from Middlebury dataset. 82 images were used for training and 10 images.

If you want to use our training set for training your model, the RGB and depth images are available in <code>training_data/RGB.mat</code> and <code>training_data/Df.mat</code> respectively. RGBD frames: 1, 20, 28, 58, 64, 66, 69, 73, 75, 79 are used for validation.
